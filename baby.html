						<b>Summer NSF REU 2013 – Expression Detection in Infants Through Facial Deformation Performance Analysis </b>
					</p>
					<p>
						I was accepted into multiple summer REU programs and participated in the one being offered at the University of South Florida. For this project I completed modified the code and technique used in the previous “Automatic Expression Spotting in Videos” project and applied it to an application where we monitor infants in maternity wards, who may not be able to make sufficient noise to alert nursing staff, to see when they are in discomfort or pain and need attending too. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Work on this project will continue in the spring once we receive IRB approval to collect our own data and start testing hardware.
